# Purpose
RPDS brings together free and opensource software to create a free, and simple to use Digital Signage system.

# Signage Management
OliveTin creates a beautifully simple web interface, sending commands to the Raspberry Pi, and managing all the signage services.

# File Management
FileBrowser provides a file managing interface within a specified directory and it can be used to upload, delete, preview, rename and edit your files

# Media Playback
VLC is at the heart of the system, and It’s being used to loop through a directory of videos, or stream directly from YouTube.

# Image Slideshow
FIM is great at displaying any image and in RPDS it loops through the images in a directory, creating amazing slideshows, or simply displaying a single logo.

# Websites
Chromium is the codebase for Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, making it arguably the best browser in the world, and it’s used in RPDS to display any website you want.

# YouTube Downloads
YouTube-DL is the opensource project allowing RPDS to download YouTube videos for offline viewing

# Music
mpg123 is one of the best command line audio players, allowing RPDS to loop through a music library.
