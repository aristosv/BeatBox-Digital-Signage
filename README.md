# Raspberry Pi Digital Signage System

This is a simple way to use a Raspberry Pi as a digital signage system. No need for a graphical user interface, no need to install a desktop. Just download the [Raspberry Pi OS Lite](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/operating-systems/) image, burn it on an SD card and boot your Raspberry Pi to the operating system. This has been tested on a Raspberry Pi 4 Model B with 4GB of RAM, but it will probably run just fine on older models also.
